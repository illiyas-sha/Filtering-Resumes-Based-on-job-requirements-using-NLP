Resume Ranking System

## MOTIVE
Screening resumes out of bulk is a challenging task and recruiters or hiring manager wastes lot of their valuable time by searching through each and every resume. Often resumes are populated with irrelevant and unnecessary information. Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume. The essence of any good recruitment strategy lies in efficient and effective resume screening. The objective of resume screening is to locate the most qualified candidates for a job. 

## Exisiting System and Problems
In existing system the hiring team would publish their vacancies in job portals, advertisements, etc,. 
The interested candidates would apply for the job by uploading their resumes which takes large amount of time and then also the candidates, are not satisfied by the job which the present system prefer according to their skills. These bulk of resumes are sorted and screened by the hiring team then the shortlisted candidates were called for further rounds of interviews. This entire hiring process is time consuming and hectic to find right candidate for right job.

## Solution
Our system will act as a handshake between two entities. i.e. the company who prefer the best possible candidate and the candidate who prefers the best possible job according to his or her skills and ability. Our system is an automated resume screening application. The collected resumes are analyzed by the application, indexed and stored in a specific format. This makes our search process easy. The analyzing system works on the algorithm that uses Natural Language Processing, subdomain of Artificial Intelligence. It reads the resumes and understands the natural language/format created by the candidate and transforms it into a specific format. This acquired knowledge is stored in then knowledge base. And the system ranks the processed resumes relatively in real-time based on the job requirements provided by the recruiter by using Natural Language Processing. The software uses natural language processing and machine learning for matching and ranking candidates in real time. This process will reduce the time and man power used for the recruitment.
